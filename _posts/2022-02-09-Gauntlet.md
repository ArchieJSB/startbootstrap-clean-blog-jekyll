# Magical Gauntlet

This was my final project that I submitted in the 3rd year of my degree, and definitely my favourite. It encompassed two elements that I really wanted to challenge myself with and showcase what I could do.

**Metal Working**
This was my first-time making metal working the primary material and process of one of my projects, especially to this level. Whilst in the past I primarily used metal to serve a function, this time I wanted to use metal to highlight the form. 
Using more advanced skills and techniques allowed me to experiment with how I shaped and styled the segmented pieces of the gauntlet, and certainly added a tangibility to the model which I doubt I personally could have achieved with painting and texturing. At least it certainly feels cool to hold the weight on your arm as if it were a real medieval gauntlet. Whilst looking back on this project, as I do with everything I work on, I realise aspects that I maybe wish I had done differently or even not done at all. However, it stands as a learning experience that I am immensely proud of, and hopefully will build on it in the years to come. This also applies to many other projects which, for many varied reasons, I would do something differently, but every project always builds my confidence and I believe advances the quality of my work.

**Electronics**
The electronics involved in this project elevated a very tangible piece into something slightly more 'otherworldly'. By using [LEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) and customized [PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) I was able to construct the desired magical effect that I wanted the gauntlet to have. I first started with the idea in my head of how I wanted the 'power' to radiate out from the gem, as if it were filling the gauntlet with magic. This then posed the question of how I would bring that to life...

Firstly, I experimented with a breadboard to code the sequence correctly with an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano), and to test the function of the [Reed Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch) which would allow for a hidden magnet in the gem to activate the LED sequence.

Once the circuit layout was configured correctly, I could then move on to joining the electronics to the gauntlet to provide the magic. With it all together, I was very pleased with the piece, and it remains my favourite work
