Hi I'm a graduate of Model Design: Special Effects BA (hons) 2022 from the University of Hertforshire, with a keen interest in design and function. I am constantly looking to improve my practical skills by learning new techniques and processes, but also refining the skills that I commonly use and hope to put to use. 

I was on the Special Effects pathway of my degree which has furthered my experience in using workshops safely and effectively which includes skills on machinery such as the; Lathe, Milling machine, metal working machines, Bandsaw, and sanding machines. My metal working stands out as my primary practice and has led to the development of my shaping and forming skills. Complimentary to this I have expanded my metal working to include skills such as Mig welding, jewelry making, and blacksmithing. Furthermore, I have developed skills in electronics. This includes programming Arduino software, remote control circuits, and adept understanding and practice in creating circuit boards and soldering.

As im always looking to expand my skills, i have also develpoed my work in 3D digital design which allows me to design concepts for projects and fabricate models. I primarily work in Rhino 3D for concept design and 3D printing and CorelDraw for laser cutting. I also have experience in Blender, Google SketchUp, and Meshmixer.

With a year of experience in the film industry, I'm now looking to continue expanding on my skills and learning new ones, both practically and as part of a team.  After completing my 3-year degree in Model Design: Special Effects BA (Hons) in 2022 at the University of Hertfordshire, I have spent a year in the prop modelling department where I have specialised in metal working, welding, woodworking, and model making.
