Hi I'm a graduate of Model Design: Special Effects BA (hons) 2022 from the University of Hertforshire, with a keen interest in design and function. I am constantly looking to improve my practical skills by learning new techniques and processes, but also refining the skills that I commonly use and hope to put to use.
